Hello, this is an example of a file that contains embedded html!<br/>
This is after the line break. It should not be a line break in gemini.  
This should however.
And this should not.

<div>Here is some text inside a div! It also includes <span style="color:green">green text</span>! It will be fully ignored, since all HTML will be stripped.</div>

Look at that!
