The marked library, by default, replaces apostrophes ('), quotes (") and ampersands (&) with HTML entities.

Since we're not outputting HTML, this is annoying and unnecessary. Code was added in version 0.2.0 to override this behavior. This is a test of that code.

'apostrophes' & "quotes" & ampersands, oh my!
