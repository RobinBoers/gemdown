# Gemdown 

This is an example document used to test Gemdown. Specifically my fork which is is a very *opiniated* version of the upstream.

Look out! This is very much a Work In Progressâ„¢. 

It does a lot of things. Forexample, it ignores some italics but keeps other *italics* or /emphasis/. It doesn't touch words_with under_scores however. It also strips all bold modifiers, but keeps `inline code`. 

It also extracts links out of paragraphs, as you might have seen. It also does it for list items: 

* I have to update to Debian 13.
* Nevermind. Arch is better!
* Nope. NixOS FTW!

=> https://archlinux.org Arch
=> https://nixorg.org NixOS

It converts list items that just contain a link to a link:

It flattens lists: 

* Something
* Something else
* Another thing

### Headings 

Level 4-6 headings are converted to paragraphs: 

#### Header :) 

Paragraphs use Markdown line wrapping rules. That means that this isn't a line break.
But this sentence is on a seperate line, because the last one ended with a "hard break", aka two spaces + newline.

Quotes work as well: 

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. 

Yea, that's about it. 

## HTML 

<span>Embedded HTML</span> is kept as is; please don't use HTML in your files. It's not really the thing Markdown was made for. 

Also,<br> does nothing. 

## Code 

Preformatted is kept as is. Here's a code snippet: 

```javascript
let x = 10;
x += 20;
console.log(x) // => 30
```

Here's some ASCII art: 

```The word "Gemdown", styled in bold letters.

## Tables 

Here's a table: 

```A table
| Name  | Surname | Age |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Robin | Boers   | 16  |
| Lize  | Boers   | 15  |
| Sean  | Ham     | 16  |
```
On the gemtext side it's turned into a nice code block. Meaning, if you formatted the table nicely in Markdown, it will render great on Gemini! 

These are some tests with footnotes[^1], weird linking stuff & yay :)
